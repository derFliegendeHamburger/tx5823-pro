'rx5808_etheli_diversity' Firmware for RX5808 Diversity Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This "etheli" version of the open-source firmware for RX5808 Diversity
modules (that plug into Fatshark Dominator goggles) is an enhancement to
the [RX5808 Diversity RealAcc Compatible
firmware](https://github.com/gc9n/rx5808-Diversity-RealAcc-Compatible). 
The main improvement is the addition of a BY-MHZ MODE that allows an
arbitrary frequency in MHz to be directly dialed in and tuned.  Other
enhancements and improvements are implemented; see the list below.

 **See here for more information:**

 Improvements:

-   Implemented BY-MHZ MODE (with favorites support)
-   Renamed 'C' and 'D' band names to 'R' and 'L'
-   Added version code (shown on main-menu screen title)
-   Improved calibration tolerance for modules with lower-than-usual
    RSSI values
-   Improved auto/seek mode
-   Modified band scan to show best channel after each sweep
-   Increased MIN_TUNE_TIME from 25 to 35 ms
-   Moved 'Diversity' item to second menu page
-   Various functional and UI-navigation improvements and fixes
-   Includes "Find Model" function (implemented by GC9N)

**Acknowledgments:**  This code is an enhancement of the open-source
code posted by [Shea Ivey](https://github.com/sheaivey/rx5808-pro-diversity) and
[GC9N](https://github.com/gc9n/rx5808-Diversity-RealAcc-Compatible), and
it would not exist without their hard work.
